# Equation-Solver

Equation Solver is a Python algorithm that has the ability to solve equations by detailling steps calculations line by line and by explaining reasoning. Here are equations list that the program can solve :

    1. ax + b = 0
    2. axÂ² + bx + c = 0
    3. ax + b = cx + d

## Requirements
- Git (optionnal)
- Python (optionnal on Windows)

## Configuration
If you are on Windows you can simply run `equation_solver.exe` otherwise follow those instructions :

- Download and extract the zip or clone the project
- Navigate into a terminal to the project folder
- Run the command `python menu.py` (requires python path in environement variables)
